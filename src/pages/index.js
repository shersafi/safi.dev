            Hi! I'm Ben, a third year Computer Science student at the University of York, currently
            working on placement at <TextLink to="https://arm.com">Arm</TextLink>.

          <h2>This Website</h2>
          <p>
            I recently decided to treat myself to a new website, because my{" "}
            <TextLink to="https://bensilverman.co.uk">old one</TextLink> was beginning to look a
            little dated, and I've learned a lot about web development in the two years since I
            wrote it!
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to take this as an opportunity to build something with my favourite new tools
            (namely React and Gatsby) that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>looked a lot nicer, with fully responsive layout and styling</li>
            <li>
              packed in a lot more functionality, like reusable components, blog posts, and more
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I might write a little post detailing the full site stack at some point, but I'm mainly
            focussed on actually coding the thing at the moment!
          </p>

              Recently I discvered a new term I really liked:{" "}
              <b>
                <i>digital gardening.</i>
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              This lovely, horticultural phrase refers to the act of "cultivating" a website full of
              little snippets, posts and tidbits, letting it naturally evolve over time instead of
              strictly managing and defining its structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              I really like the concept of this, so it's not entirely impossible that I'll begin to
              use this site as my own <Emoji emoji="ðŸŒ±" /> digital garden <Emoji emoji="ðŸŒ±" /> of
              sorts, setting it up to hold various different types of{" "}
              <TextLink to="/posts">blog posts</TextLink>, snippets, and pages that I think are
              interesting or useful (either to me or others).
