# Hello!

As I continue to work on this website, I thought it would be a good idea to set up my first blog post.

## My Goals

I have a few goals in mind, such as diversifying my skills in terms of programming and Mathematics. For the past few years, my focus has always been on website development, and building applications.
However, I have a new found passion in programming beyond just these and instead, I would like to focus on Cryptography and Machine Learning. 

## How Will I Achieve my Goals?

I document everything I do, and for one, these blog posts will help me stay on track to achieve my goals. I also schedule everything I do in a day to help me stay organized, and ensure to 
dedicate at least an hour or two everyday towards x or y topic. I will also remember to start small and work my way up.

```python
import numpy as np 

def sigmoid(x):
  return (1 / (1+ np.exp(-x))) #basic activation funct.
```

<aside>It is even possible to implement neural networks just by using plain NumPy!</aside>
